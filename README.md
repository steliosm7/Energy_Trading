## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/steliosm7/Energy_Trading/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
import urllib, json
import requests
import xlrd

from urllib import request
# Define the remote file to retrieve
remote_url = 'https://www.admie.gr/getOperationMarketFilewRange?dateStart=2021-8-01&dateEnd=2021-8-02&FileCategory=ISPWeekAheadLoadForecast'
# Define the local filename to save data
local_file = 'testfile.json'
# Download remote and save locally
request.urlretrieve(remote_url, local_file)

with open('testfile.json') as json_file:
    testfile = json.load(json_file)
testfile
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/steliosm7/Energy_Trading/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
